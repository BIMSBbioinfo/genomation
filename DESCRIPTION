Description: A package for annotation of genomic features. Users can visualize and quantify genomic features over pre-defined functional regions, such as promoters, exons, introns, etc. The genomic features represent regions with a defined chromosome position, which may be associated with a score, such as aligned reads from HT-seq experiments, TF binding sites, methylation scores, etc. The package can use any tabular genomic feature data as long as it has minimal information on the locations of genomic features.
