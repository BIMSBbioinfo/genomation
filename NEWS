genomation 1.5.7
--------------
NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES
* scoreMatrixBin() calculates coverage over windows that are not only
  GRanges, but also GRangesList. It's usefull for calculating transcript
  coverage of a set of exons.
* ScoreMatrix-like functions work with bigWig files
  and supplied weight.col and is.noCovNA=TRUE
  
IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES
* Added warning for rpm=TRUE and type='bigWig'
* type='auto' by default in ScoreMatrix-like functions 
* narrowPeak() and broadPeak() are 0-based by default (#144 fixed)
* Fixed error in readGeneric when reading files with numeric chromosomes (#133 fixed)
* Show warning if windows fall off target 
* Show error if windows have width 1


genomation 1.5.6
--------------
NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES
* annotateWithFeatures() function added for a diversity of annotation operations
  bases on genomic interval overlap. 
* heatTargetAnnotation() returns a heatmap for percentage of genomic intervals
  overlapping with annotation features. These functions are more general than
  the old annotation functions and could be used in variety of settings.
* plotGeneAnnotation() is depracated, use heatTargetAnnotation() instead. It 
  does the same job and has more features.


genomation 1.5.5
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES
* fixed warnings related to "[" function of ScoreMatrix and ScoreMatrixList
* fixed issue "scoreMatrixList drops names after subsetting #141"
* fixed issue "heatMeta returns a list not a matrix #142"
* fixed vignette issue, now things do not depend on knitrBootstrap #143

--------------

  ScoreMatrix/ScoreMatrixBin for windows was not sorted by coordinates, 
  then the results were distorted.

      (new name reflects TRUE)
    - use new invertStrand() instead of GenomicAlignments:::invertRleStrand() 
    - bump version prior to creation of 3.3 branch, 
      bump version of all packages that use knitr for vignettes,
      and bump version to trigger package rebuilding now that purl()'ing issue.

--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* knitrBootstrap update

genomation 1.3.4
--------------

   (readTableFast converted their numeric values to positive integers)
  
genomation 1.3.2
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  strands of reads in paired-end BAM files are inferred depending on strand of 
   first alignment from the pair. It's a default setting of the strandMode argument
   in the readGAlignmentPairs function.
*  added new argument to ScoreMatrix, ScoreMatrixBin and ScoreMatrixList functions
   library.size indicating total number of aligned reads of a BAM file for
   normalization.

  ScoreMatrixList functions

*  Improve reading paired-end alignment in score matrix functions.
   In order to avoid duplicated reads from GenomicAlignments:readGAlignmentPairs
   reads with repeated ids are removed (with assumption that reads have unique ids).

genomation 1.1.20
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  test more examples (remove \donttest{} from examples
   responsible for reading data, e.g. readBed, include into \donttest{}
   only those parts of examples that are slow, e.g. plotMeta(.,.))

genomation 1.1.19
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* Arithmetic, indicator and logic operations as well as subsetting work on ScoreMatrix, 
  ScoreMatrixBin and ScoreMatrixList objects. New functionality at "ScoreMatrix-class"
  and "ScoreMatrixList-class" are documented in help pages.

  that has no more 'asRangedData' arg.

genomation 1.1.16
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* issue with readBam() used in scoreMatrix() to read bam files.
  Reading paired-end reads was extremely slow, because of lines of code
  that were responsible for checking if both mates from pair are not counted twice,
  e.g. when mates map into two different windows of interest. Right now we allow it.
  Fixed bug in reading single-end reads.

genomation 1.1.15
--------------

  GRanges object ("windows" argument) did not have the same chromosome ordering. In that case,
  the returned score matrix was correct but the row ordering did not correspond to the row
  ordering supplied in the windows argument.
