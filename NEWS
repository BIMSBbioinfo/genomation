genomation 1.1.19
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* Arithmetic, indicator and logic operations as well as subsetting work on ScoreMatrix, 
  ScoreMatrixBin and ScoreMatrixList objects. New functionality at "ScoreMatrix-class"
  and "ScoreMatrixList-class" are documented in help pages.
* Commented examples of functions are uncommented or \donttest{} is used.

genomation 1.1.18
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* Integration of Travis CI

genomation 1.1.17
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* Bioconductor Git-SVN bridge improved rtracklayer::import() function 
  that has no more 'asRangedData' arg.

genomation 1.1.16
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* issue with readBam() used in scoreMatrix() to read bam files.
  Reading paired-end reads was extremely slow, because of lines of code
  that were responsible for checking if both mates from pair are not counted twice,
  e.g. when mates map into two different windows of interest. Right now we allow it.
  Fixed bug in reading single-end reads.

genomation 1.1.15
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* fix bug of plotMeta() when dispersion=NULL and smoothfun is not NULL

genomation 1.1.14
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* improve checking if the ncols of matrices match in heatMeta() and plotMeta()

genomation 1.1.13
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* add new argument cex.legend to plotTargetAnnotation() to specify the size of the legend.
* changed ScoreMatrixBin() to run faster when noCovNA=TRUE
* check not only for .bw but also .bigWig and .bigwig extensions of BigWig file in ScoreMatrix() and ScoreMatrixBin()

genomation 1.1.12
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* gffToGRanges is now a wrapper for import from rtracklayer

genomation 1.1.11
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* plotMeta function bug fixed. The error occured during plotting meta-profile when dispersion=NULL.
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wreczycka.

genomation 1.1.10
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* changes in heatMatrix() and plotMeta() - dispersion, smoothfun and clustfun arguments
  changed from be default FALSE to NULL.

genomation 1.1.9
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* ScoreMatrix function bug fixed. The bug occured when RleList object ("target" argument) and 
  GRanges object ("windows" argument) did not have the same chromosome ordering. In that case,
  the returned score matrix was correct but the row ordering did not correspond to the row
  ordering supplied in the windows argument.
  
  
genomation 1.1.8
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* changes in the vignette, updated the AnnotationHub example, thanks to Christopher Bottoms 
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.7
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* extended capabilities for meta-plots; added new parameters to plotMeta()
  that enable to show dispersion interval bands around 
  a central tendency (mean or median) and smoothing them. 
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.6
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* heatMatrix() and multiHeatMatrix() can visualizate score matrix/matrices clustered
  by using not only kmeans, but custom clustering function (clustfun argument).
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wreczycka.
  
genomation 1.1.5
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* changes in the vignette,explicit call to GenomicRanges::countOverlaps, thanks to Christopher Bottoms
  
genomation 1.1.4
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* scoreMatrix, scoreMatrixBin and ScoreMatrixList read paired-end BAM files. 
  Paired reads are treated as fragments. Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.3
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* Functions that read data from text files re-written from 
  data.table::fread() to readr::read_delim()
  and now they can read compressed files from a URL
* Changes in readBed(), readNarrowPeak(), readBroadPeak() and gffToGRanges() arguments; 
  All of them have now track.line argument that can be FALSE,
  "auto" or an integer indicating number of first lines to skip.
  The zero.based argument was added to readBed() that tells whether ranges in the bed file
  are in 0 or 1-based coordinate system.
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.2
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* scoreMatrixList() runs in parallel by using parallel::mclapply(). Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.1
--------------
NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* We are in BioC

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* readGeneric() and all the functions that read data from text files are faster
  due to use of data.table::fread(). Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka
