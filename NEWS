genomation 1.5.2
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* merged updates from BioC SVN repository:
    - elementLengths was renamed -> elementNROWS in S4Vectors 
      (new name reflects TRUE)
    - use new invertStrand() instead of GenomicAlignments:::invertRleStrand() 
    - bump version prior to creation of 3.3 branch, 
      bump version of all packages that use knitr for vignettes,
      and bump version to trigger package rebuilding now that purl()'ing issue.

genomation 1.3.5
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* knitrBootstrap update

genomation 1.3.4
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  RPM is computed based on mapped reads only 
   (before it was computed on all reads).

genomation 1.3.3
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  fixed reading genomic files with numeric metadata columns
   (readTableFast converted their numeric values to positive integers)
  
genomation 1.3.2
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  strands of reads in paired-end BAM files are inferred depending on strand of 
   first alignment from the pair. It's a default setting of the strandMode argument
   in the readGAlignmentPairs function.
*  added new argument to ScoreMatrix, ScoreMatrixBin and ScoreMatrixList functions
   library.size indicating total number of aligned reads of a BAM file for
   normalization.
* removed argument stranded from ScoreMatrix, ScoreMatrixBin and 
  ScoreMatrixList functions

genomation 1.3.1
--------------

   readTableFast() was changed

genomation 1.1.26
--------------

   which matrices are used for clustering

genomation 1.1.21
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  Improve reading paired-end alignment in score matrix functions.
   In order to avoid duplicated reads from GenomicAlignments:readGAlignmentPairs
   reads with repeated ids are removed (with assumption that reads have unique ids).

genomation 1.1.20
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

*  test more examples (remove \donttest{} from examples
   responsible for reading data, e.g. readBed, include into \donttest{}
   only those parts of examples that are slow, e.g. plotMeta(.,.))

genomation 1.1.19
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* Arithmetic, indicator and logic operations as well as subsetting work on ScoreMatrix, 
  ScoreMatrixBin and ScoreMatrixList objects. New functionality at "ScoreMatrix-class"
  and "ScoreMatrixList-class" are documented in help pages.
* Commented examples of functions are uncommented or \donttest{} is used.

genomation 1.1.18
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* Integration of Travis CI

genomation 1.1.17
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* Bioconductor Git-SVN bridge improved rtracklayer::import() function 
  that has no more 'asRangedData' arg.

genomation 1.1.16
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* issue with readBam() used in scoreMatrix() to read bam files.
  Reading paired-end reads was extremely slow, because of lines of code
  that were responsible for checking if both mates from pair are not counted twice,
  e.g. when mates map into two different windows of interest. Right now we allow it.
  Fixed bug in reading single-end reads.

genomation 1.1.15
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* fix bug of plotMeta() when dispersion=NULL and smoothfun is not NULL

genomation 1.1.14
--------------

--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* add new argument cex.legend to plotTargetAnnotation() to specify the size of the legend.
* changed ScoreMatrixBin() to run faster when noCovNA=TRUE
* check not only for .bw but also .bigWig and .bigwig extensions of BigWig file in ScoreMatrix() and ScoreMatrixBin()

--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* gffToGRanges is now a wrapper for import from rtracklayer

genomation 1.1.11
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

  Implemented by Katarzyna Wreczycka.

genomation 1.1.10
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* changes in heatMatrix() and plotMeta() - dispersion, smoothfun and clustfun arguments
  changed from be default FALSE to NULL.

genomation 1.1.9
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* ScoreMatrix function bug fixed. The bug occured when RleList object ("target" argument) and 
  GRanges object ("windows" argument) did not have the same chromosome ordering. In that case,
  the returned score matrix was correct but the row ordering did not correspond to the row
  ordering supplied in the windows argument.

  that enable to show dispersion interval bands around 
  a central tendency (mean or median) and smoothing them. 
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.6
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* heatMatrix() and multiHeatMatrix() can visualizate score matrix/matrices clustered
  by using not only kmeans, but custom clustering function (clustfun argument).

* Functions that read data from text files re-written from 
  data.table::fread() to readr::read_delim()
  and now they can read compressed files from a URL
* Changes in readBed(), readNarrowPeak(), readBroadPeak() and gffToGRanges() arguments; 
  All of them have now track.line argument that can be FALSE,
  "auto" or an integer indicating number of first lines to skip.
  The zero.based argument was added to readBed() that tells whether ranges in the bed file
  are in 0 or 1-based coordinate system.
  Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.2
--------------

* scoreMatrixList() runs in parallel by using parallel::mclapply(). Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka.

genomation 1.1.1
--------------
NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* We are in BioC

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* readGeneric() and all the functions that read data from text files are faster
  due to use of data.table::fread(). Implemented by Katarzyna Wręczycka
