{"name":"genomation","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Genomation.\r\nThis is an R package that contains a collection of tools for visualizing and analyzing genome-wide data sets.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Ability to work with multiple flat file formats such as BED,GFF,BAM, bigWig and generic tabular text files \r\n* Annotation of genomic intervals. For example, you can see what percentage of your genomic intervals overlaps with exon/intron/promoter annotation. \r\n* Summary of genomic scores or read coverages over pre-defined regions. The pre-defined regions can be equi-width such as region around TSS or could be a set of regions with varying widths such as CpG islands. This operation will result in a matrix or set of matrices containing scores for each pre-defined region \r\n* Visualisation of summary matrices such as meta-region(meta-gene, meta-promoter, etc.) plots or heatmaps. \r\nThese functions can employ K-means clustering of rows of summary matrices as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n## installation \r\nYou can install genomation via install_github() function from [devtools package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html).\r\n`\r\n# Install dependencies\r\ninstall.packages( c(\"data.table\",\"plyr\",\"reshape2\",\"ggplot2\",\"gridBase\",\"devtools\"))\r\nsource(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\nbiocLite(c(\"GenomicRanges\",\"rtracklayer\",\"impute\",\"Rsamtools\"))\r\n\r\n# install the packages\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"genomation\", username = \"al2na\")\r\n`\r\n\r\n## Data import\r\nFunctions such as readBed,gff2GRanges and readGeneric can read multiple flat file formats as GRanges objects into R.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summarise GRanges object on promoters\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summarise BAM files on promoters\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summarise BigWig files on promoters\r\n\r\n## Visualize summary matrices as heatmap\r\n\r\n\r\n## Visualize summary matrices as meta-region plots\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nVedran Franke (@frenkiboy) and Altuna Akalin (@al2na) authored this package.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nsend an e-mail to genomation@googlegroups.com or use the web interface\r\nto post a question\r\n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/genomation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/genomation)","google":"UA-47762010-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
