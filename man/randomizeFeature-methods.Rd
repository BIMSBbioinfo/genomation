\title{function that randomizes the genomic coordinates}
\usage{
randomizeFeature(feature, chrom.sizes = NULL, stranded = TRUE,
  keep.strand.prop = TRUE, keep.chrom = TRUE, exclude = NULL,
  include = NULL, seed = NULL, nrand = 1)

\S4method{randomizeFeature}{GRanges}(feature, chrom.sizes = NULL,
  stranded = TRUE, keep.strand.prop = TRUE, keep.chrom = TRUE,
  exclude = NULL, include = NULL, seed = NULL, nrand = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature}{a GRanges object to be randomized}

\item{chrom.sizes}{sizes of chromosomes as a named vector (names are
chromsomes names and elements of the vectors are lengths). , if not
given sizes in GRanges object will be used if no sizes there the end
of each chr will be the end last feature on each chr}

\item{stranded}{if FALSE, all of the returned features will be strandless
(will have "*" in the strand slot)}

\item{keep.strand.prop}{If TRUE strands will have the same proportion as the
features}

\item{keep.chrom}{If TRUE, number of features and randomized features for a
chromosome will match. Currently seeting this to FALSE is not supported.}

\item{exclude}{A GRanges object where no randomized feature should overlap,
can be gaps or unmappable regions in the genome as an example.}

\item{include}{A GRanges object which defines the boundaries of randomized
features. If not provided the whole genome is used, as defined using
the chrom.sizes parameter.}

\item{seed}{random number generator seed}

\item{nrand}{number of randomizations (default:1)}
}
\value{
returns a GRanges object which is randomized version of the feature,
along with a "set" column in the metadata which designates to which iteration
of the randomization the range belong.
}
\description{
This function randomly distributes the coordinates of genomic features which
is stored in a \code{GRanges} object. The randomization can be constrained by
 supplied arguments.
The function is still in Beta mode - the regions can overlap excluded regions, and the randomized regions are not disjoint. Please take care that the excluded and included regions are not too strict when compared to the total width of the ranges.
