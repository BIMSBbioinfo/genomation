\title{Get the percentage/count of annotation features overlapping with target
features from AnnotationByFeature}
\usage{
getFeatsWithTargetsStats(x,percentage=TRUE)

\S4method{getFeatsWithTargetsStats}{AnnotationByFeature}(x, percentage = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{AnnotationByFeature}  object}

\item{percentage}{TRUE|FALSE. If TRUE percentage of annotation features will
       be returned. If FALSE, number of annotation features will be returned}
}
\value{
RETURNS  a vector of percentages or counts showing quantity
        of annotation features overlapping with target features
}
\description{
This function retrieves percentage/number of
annotation features overlapping with targets.
For example, if \code{AnnotationByFeature}  object is containing
statistics of differentially methylated
regions overlapping with gene annotation. This function will return
number/percentage of introns,exons and promoters
overlapping with differentially methylated regions.
