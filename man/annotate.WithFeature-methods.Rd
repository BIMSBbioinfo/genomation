\usage{
  annotate.WithFeature(target,feature,strand=FALSE,extend=0,feature.name="feat1")
}
\arguments{
  \item{target}{a GRanges object storing chromosome
  locations to be annotated}

  \item{feature}{a GRanges object storing chromosome
  locations of a feature (can be CpG islands, ChIP-seq
  peaks, etc)}

  \item{strand}{If set to TRUE, annotation features and
  target features will be overlapped based on strand
  (def:FAULT)}

  \item{extend}{specifiying a positive value will extend
  the feature on both sides as much as \code{extend}}

  \item{feature.name}{name of the annotation feature. For
  example: H3K4me1,CpGisland etc.}
}
\value{
  returns an \code{annotationByFeature} object
